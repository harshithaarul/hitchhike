Connect to ec2:
1. make sure you "git pull" and have hitchhike2.pem in the folder
2. go to the directory with the hitchhike2.pem folder (probably the root folder for this repo)
3. sudo ssh -i "hitchhike2.pem" ubuntu@ec2-13-59-36-193.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
Note: MAKE SURE YOU USE SUDO, otherwise it will complain that the .pem file is accessible to everyone; changing file permissions did not solve my issue
