### Downloading the app using the link:

   https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gX4RNcS0mTrx4BXN3j2m9gmyT4dowdrV/view

Make sure to allow installing APKs from Google Drive and bypass Play Protect when installing and running. 

### Running the app easily (Android):
1. Install the Expo app from the Play Store.
2. Go to: https://expo.io/@ssuresh3/frontend
3. Scan the QR code on the webpage.
4. Enjoy! (Please report if this doesn't work)

### How to run the app the harder way:

1. Please clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Make sure to download `npm` and `expo-cli`.

3. Download the Expo app on your phone.

4. Afterwards on your local machine, go to `hitchhike/frontend`

5. Type `npm start`

6. If you are on iOS, scan the QR code using the camera app. Follow the notification to the Expo app, where the HitchHike app will run.

   If you are on Android, scan the QR code directly from the Expo app. HitchHike will automatically open up.

### Troubleshooting:

* Make sure you have the latest version of Node.JS installed on your computer.

* If you are having trouble with missing npm modules, run the command `npm install` in the `hitchhike/frontend` directory. This should install all of the necessary modules. **This may take a few minutes.**

* Open an issue in the repository to report any bugs. We will resolve these issues as soon as possible. We appreciate your support through the development process, and we hope you enjoy the app!
